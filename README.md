# PixelArt2BMZ
PixelArt2BMZ is an easy-to-use Python project that converts pixel art images into BattleminerZ maps. It detects the closest color match for each pixel in the image and maps it to the corresponding block in the game. This tool is perfect for creating custom maps or adding a touch of artistic flair to your BattleminerZ world.

#Key features include:

Automatic color matching: The script intelligently matches pixel colors to the most similar block colors in the game.
Block count output: Get a detailed breakdown of the number of each block type used in the conversion.
Visual map preview: Generate a visual map that highlights the placement and type of each block.
User-friendly: Designed for ease of use, this script takes care of the complex conversion process for you, allowing you to focus on creating stunning pixel art.
To use this project, simply provide the path to your pixel art image and run the script. The program will generate a BattleminerZ map and display a visual representation of the map, complete with block counts and labels. Happy map-making!
